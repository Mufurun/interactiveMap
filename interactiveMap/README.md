# Project Interactive Map 
by Nobuto Arai

- This interactive map shows the locations of important locations of forestry industry on the coastal BC. 


# Purpose
- This suceeds the project from 2024 summer at the BC Forest Discovery Centre.
- I hope someone else continues this project to update data in the long run.


# Methods
## Map
  I will do (check if they are done):
- [ ] Data Management
  - [x] Organize the location
  - [x] Photos
  - [x] Texts
  - [x] Tittle
  - [x] Years (range)
  - [x] Descriptions
  - [x] Additional Sources
- [ ] Controls
  - [x] Allow users to zoom up by the region
  - [ ] Allow users to filter points by the year
  - [ ] Allow users to filter points by categories (sawmill, camp, pulp mill, town??)
- [ ] use something like satelite imagery later, but right now I am using just a normal map
  
# Distribution
 - This is not publicly available. 
 - The repo is private, so only those permitted are accessible.

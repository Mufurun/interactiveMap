# Project Interactive Map 
by Nobuto Arai

- This interactive map shows the locations of important locations of forestry industry on the coastal BC. 


# Purpose
- This suceeds the project from 2024 summer. 
- Everything is attributed to the BC Forest Discovery Centre

# Methods
## Map
  I will do (check if they are done):
- [ ] Data Management
  - [ ] Organize the location
  - [ ] Upload some photos
  - [ ] Upload texts
  - [ ] Titile
  - [ ] Years (range)
- [ ] Controls
  - [ ] Allow users to zoom up by the region
  - [ ] Allow users to filter points by the year
  - [ ] Allow users to filter points by categories (sawmill, camp, pulp mill, town??)
- [ ] use something like satelite imagery later, but right now I am using just a normal map
